### Data Type Conversion
The process of converting the value of one data type (integer, string, float, etc.) to another data type is called type conversion. Python defines type conversion functions to directly convert one data type to another

### Input Output
For a program to be useful, it usually needs to communicate with the user by obtaining input data and displaying result data back to the user.

### Dynamic Typing
Python is a dynamically typed language. When declaring a variable in Python, you donâ€™t specify a type for it, which means the Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.


### Number, Character, and String Transformation
### Python Check in String
### String Formatting
### List, Set, and String Operation
### Operator, Operands and Expression
Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand. Expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value. Python divides the operators in the following groups:
- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators

### Conditional Expression
#### if condition
- In python the expression is placed after the if and the decision is based on the truth value of the expression
- If the expression evaluates to True, the statement block will be executed
- If the expression evaluates to false, then the next block (after the if) will be executed
#### else condition
- Can be combined with if statement, as a way out when the IF condition is false
- Else is optional and singular
#### elif condition
- Elif is short for else if
- Elif is an alternative to nested if
- An IF statement can be executed for one or more elif statements (optional and not restricted)
