### Data Type Conversion
The process of converting the value of one data type (integer, string, float, etc.) to another data type is called type conversion. Python defines type conversion functions to directly convert one data type to another

### Input Output
For a program to be useful, it usually needs to communicate with the user by obtaining input data and displaying result data back to the user.

### Dynamic Typing
Python is a dynamically typed language. When declaring a variable in Python, you donâ€™t specify a type for it, which means the Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.


### Number, Character, and String Transformation
### Python Check in String
### String Formatting
### List, Set, and String Operation
### Operator, Operands and Expression
### Conditional Expression
